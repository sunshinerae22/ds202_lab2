choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
rating <- choco[,'Rating']
hist(rating)
1) The histogram is unimodal, mostly symmetrical with one outlier

cocoa <- choco[,'Cocoa.Pct']
plot(cocoa, rating)
abline(lm(rating~cocoa), col = 'red')

2) It looks like there is a slight negative correlation between the ratings and the percentage of cacao in the chocolate, but that could also be attributed to other factors.
