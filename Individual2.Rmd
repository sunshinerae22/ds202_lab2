```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
ratings <- choco$Rating
cacao <- choco$Cocoa.Pct
```


```{r ratings, echo=FALSE}
hist(ratings)
```

The historgram of chocolate ratings shows a unimodel distribution centered at 3.5 that looks roughly normal. There appear to be outliers to the right. 

```{r choco, echo=FALSE}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating, main="Ratings by Cocoa Percent", xlab="Coca Percent", ylab="Ratings")
coco.lm = lm(choco$Rating~choco$Cocoa.Pct)
abline(coco.lm)
coco.lm
```

r^2 value: 

```{r coco.lm, echo=FALSE}
summary(coco.lm)$r.squared
```

There seems to be no realtionship between ratings and cocao percent, the coeficient is <.02 with an r-squared value of .026 which means only .026% of the variation of ratings is explained by cocao percent.
